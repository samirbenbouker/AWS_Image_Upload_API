# AWS_Image_Upload_API
Application to upload and download files (images) for a react front end application. Implemented everything from scratch using Spring Boot for the backend and Amazon S3 for storing files (images). For the front he will use react and hooks.

The project itself does not work since it would lack the AWS credentials that I currently do not have.
It was just a practice with Amazon services
